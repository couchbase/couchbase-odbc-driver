# Black Duck cannot identify any of the third-party dependencies we use, so
# have to inform it by hand. This file is how we specify all third-party
# dependencies; it will be consumed by the Black Duck scans.
#
# This should include all *transitive* dependencies as well. eg., for Poco,
# it should include all packages that Poco embeds within itself. We will
# have to manually extract those packages/versions.
#
# We also need to keep this file up-to-date. Whenever the Poco submodule is
# updated, we must check the version of Poco and all transitive dependencies
# and update this file by hand.
